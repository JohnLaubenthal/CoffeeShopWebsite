                Located in scenic downtown Elyria, Ohio, On The Grounds Coffee Shop opened in 2018 and is owned and operated by the Thomas J. Smith family.  Mr. Smith, along with his wife Cathy have always wanted to own and operate their own "family business".  Upon retirement in 2016, they began planning what would later become, "On The Grounds Coffee Shop".  Stop in and try out an assortment of different types of coffee that the Smith family have to offer.
